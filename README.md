I forced myself to learn C++ to make these simulations :) . Space is, in my opinion, the most intriguing thing humanity has ever tried to understand â€” vast, mysterious, and full of challenges that push the limits of our imagination and technology.
I made this repository to help spread my love of space and maybe even teach people a thing or two with these codes and simulations.
